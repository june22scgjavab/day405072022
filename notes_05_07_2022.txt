--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some of the commonly made mistakes with insert.

We have not mentioned the column names and also skipped the value for author2. This way of writing the 
statement is not allowed

INSERT INTO bookdetails VALUES(4,'DBMS',500,'Nitin','2010-02-23');

Error Code: 1136. Column count doesn't match value count at row 1	

We wanted to have a null value in author2 but we provided the null value within single quote. Now the
null value is not the unknown or undefined value but the author name is null.

INSERT INTO bookdetails VALUES(5,'DBMS',500,'Nitin','null','2010-02-23');

We mentioned more values as compared to the number of columns 

INSERT INTO bookdetails VALUES(6,'DBMS',500,'Nitin','Ashok','Radha','2010-02-23');


Error Code: 1136. Column count doesn't match value count at row 1
