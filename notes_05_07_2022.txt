CREATE TABLE bookdetails(
 bookid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
 title VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,   -- We are not allowed to leave the value of this column
 price FLOAT(6,2) NOT NULL,
 author1 VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
 author2 VARCHAR(20),
 dateofpub DATE
);

/* The below insert statment is not having column names after the table name which means
 we are entering the data in the same sequence as of when the table got created
 and we are entering the data for all the columns */

INSERT INTO bookdetails VALUES(1,'Java',600,'Patrick',null,'1985-12-01');

/* The below insert statment is having the column names after the table name which means
 we are entering the data for the columns mentioned after the table name. This is same as the way 
we mentioned in the previous statement  */

INSERT INTO bookdetails(bookid,title,price,author1,author2,dateofpub) VALUES(2,'HTML',300,'Robbert','Jack',null);

/* The below insert statement is provided with the values but the column sequence is not same as 
what we have mentioned while creating the table */

INSERT INTO bookdetails(title,author1,author2,price,bookid,dateofpub) VALUES('CSS','Jack','Marry',300,3,'2010-10-20');

/* In the below SQL statement we have skipped the author2 column which means the value for author2 whill
be null ( undefined or unknown)
INSERT INTO bookdetails(bookid,title,price,author1,dateofpub) VALUES(4,'DBMS',500,'Nitin','2010-02-23');

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some of the commonly made mistakes with insert.

We have not mentioned the column names and also skipped the value for author2. This way of writing the 
statement is not allowed

INSERT INTO bookdetails VALUES(4,'DBMS',500,'Nitin','2010-02-23');

Error Code: 1136. Column count doesn't match value count at row 1	

We wanted to have a null value in author2 but we provided the null value within single quote. Now the
null value is not the unknown or undefined value but the author name is null.

INSERT INTO bookdetails VALUES(5,'DBMS',500,'Nitin','null','2010-02-23');

We mentioned more values as compared to the number of columns 

INSERT INTO bookdetails VALUES(6,'DBMS',500,'Nitin','Ashok','Radha','2010-02-23');


Error Code: 1136. Column count doesn't match value count at row 1


If column names are used then the data provided in the values clause must have the same data type of column at same position.

INSERT INTO bookdetails(title,author1,author2,price,bookid,dateofpub) VALUES('CSS','Jack','Marry',300,30,'Hi');
	
Error Code: 1292. Incorrect date value: 'Hi' for column 'dateofpub' at row 1

In the below insert command we are inserting null for book title but book title cannot have a null value.

INSERT INTO bookdetails VALUES(10,null,600,'Patrick',null,'1985-12-01');

	Error Code: 1048. Column 'title' cannot be null	

----------------------------
Let us create a new table bookdetailsbackup which will get the data from bookdetails.

CREATE TABLE bookdetailsbackup(
 bookid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
 title VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,   
 price FLOAT(6,2) NOT NULL,
 author1 VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
 author2 VARCHAR(20),
 dateofpub DATE
);

INSERT INTO bookdetailsbackup SELECT * FROM bookdetails;



CREATE TABLE bookdetailsbackup2(
 bookid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
 title VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,   
 price FLOAT(6,2) NOT NULL,
);
INSERT INTO bookdetailsbackup2 SELECT * FROM bookdetails;


Error Code: 1136. Column count doesn't match value count at row 1


INSERT INTO bookdetailsbackup2 SELECT bookid,title,price FROM bookdetails;

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
CREATE TABLE customer(
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
address VARCHAR(30) default 'Delhi'
);

INSERT INTO customer VALUES(1,'Abhi','Kolkata');
INSERT INTO customer(id,name) VALUES(2,'Gaytri');
INSERT INTO customer VALUES(3,'Sudesh',null);
INSERT INTO customer VALUES(3,'Adil',null);

Error Code: 1062. Duplicate entry '3' for key 'customer.PRIMARY'	
INSERT INTO customer VALUES(null,'Adil',null);
Error Code: 1048. Column 'id' cannot be null	


create TABLE employees (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
votersid INTEGER UNIQUE);

INSERT INTO employees VALUES(1,'Ram',1234567);
INSERT INTO employees VALUES(2,'Jatin',null);
INSERT INTO employees VALUES(3,'Rakesh',null);
INSERT INTO employees VALUES(4,'Amit',1234567);
Error Code: 1062. Duplicate entry '1234567' for key 'employees.votersid'	


Can you deferentiate between unique key and primary key?
We can have only one primary key/column per table but unique keys/column can be many.
primary key cannot have a null value whereas unique key can have null value/values.
